# --- Tunnel interface detection ---------------------------------------------
#
# The tunnel our gpclient brings up is either gpd0 (created exclusively by
# gpclient) or a kernel-assigned tunN device - openconnect falls back to the
# latter, and N is simply the first free number. A fixed candidate list used
# to be enough, but it caps how many *foreign* tunN VPNs may be up at once:
# with two other tun-based VPNs already holding tun0 and tun1, our own tunnel
# lands on tun2, which no fixed list predicted, so detection polled forever
# until NetworkManager's vpn.timeout killed the connection (issue #13).
#
# So the candidates are discovered at runtime instead. The safety work is done
# by the pre-existing-interface snapshot (issue #7) and by matching the tunnel
# against the file descriptors our own gpclient process holds - not by the
# length of a hardcoded list.

# --- VPN DNS handed back from vpnc-script -----------------------------------
#
# The DNS servers and search domains the gateway pushes are applied by
# vpnc-script directly to systemd-resolved, and NetworkManager never learns
# about them: it sees an assumed tunnel device with an empty DNS configuration.
# The next time NetworkManager recomputes DNS for an unrelated reason (an IPv6
# router advertisement on the physical interface is enough) it pushes that
# empty configuration to systemd-resolved, wiping the VPN resolver while the
# tunnel keeps running (issue #15).
#
# Our /etc/vpnc/connect.d hook therefore records INTERNAL_IP4_DNS,
# CISCO_DEF_DOMAIN and CISCO_SPLIT_DNS in this file (the path is handed to
# gpclient in the environment), and tunnel detection reports them to
# NetworkManager in Ip4Config - so NetworkManager owns the resolver state and
# reapplies the same servers on every recalculation.

#   Re-run it with the `--fix-openssl` option to work around this issue
#
# gpclient has the workaround built in (a temporary OPENSSL_CONF enabling
# UnsafeLegacyServerConnect, also passed on to gpauth), but it has to be asked
# for with a global flag placed before the subcommand. We watch for the error
# and retry once with the flag, so nobody has to know the option exists

# profile afterwards so the connection editor can offer it (issue #7).
#
# Only the FIRST frame is a stream of complete lines. inquire redraws
# incrementally (FrameRenderer): it moves the cursor back to the top of the

# --- Interactive prompt detection -------------------------------------------

# For portals that do NOT use SAML (Prelogin::Standard in gpclient, e.g. RSA

# its terminal via the `inquire` crate:
#
#   Please enter RSA token (Portal: vpn.example.com)   <- plain println banner
#   ? Username:                                        <- inquire Text prompt
#   ? Password:                                        <- inquire Password prompt
#
# and for gateway MFA challenges:
#
#   ? <server-provided message>                        <- inquire Text prompt
#
# We run gpclient under a PTY so those prompts actually render, detect them in
# the output stream and answer them either from secrets stored in the NM
# connection or interactively via the SecretsRequired/NewSecrets D-Bus flow.
